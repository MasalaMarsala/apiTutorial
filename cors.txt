If you encounter a CORS error when running your file, add the following code between your <head> tags:

<meta http-equiv="Access-Control-Allow-Origin" content="https://dictionaryapi.dev"/>

This will allow your browser to access the specific API we are using in this tutorial.
You can change "https://dictionaryapi.dev" to "*" to give your webpage to all websites. Just note that this may create an open door to your website.
